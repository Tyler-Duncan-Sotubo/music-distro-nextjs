    <h2>What is a record label?</h2>
<p>Record labels are brands or companies responsible for producing, promoting and ultimately distributing the recordings of their signed or associated acts. They can be big or small, major or independent.</p>
<h2>What does a record label do?</h2>
<p>Within a label’s set-up, various departments specialise in certain areas of the music life-cycle. This usually includes marketing, legal and music distribution departments - all collaborating to maximise record sales (both physical and digital) and enhance the visibility of the label’s artists.</p>
<h2>What are the major music labels?</h2>
<p>The Big Three: Warner Music Group (WMG), Universal Music Group (UMG) and Sony Music Entertainment. Seen by many as the music industry 'bad guys', these three major labels hold the majority share of the record label market.</p>
<p>Securing a record deal at one of the Big Three used to be seen as the be-all and end-all of musical success, but with the growth of indies - not so much anymore. </p>
<p>Within the majors' umbrellas, you'll find smaller labels. For example, UMG's umbrella includes Island, Capitol and Polydor and Sony's features Columbia, RCA and Epic Records.</p>
<p>The rest of the market share is made up of independent label owners - like you! With this share increasing year on year, there's now more more opportunities than ever to make money as an independent record label.</p>
<h3>Starting a record label is a dream for many music lovers, but it can be a daunting task. There are so many things to consider, from finding and signing artists to marketing and distributing their music. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of starting a record label in 2024.</h3>
<h2>1. Define your niche</h2>
<img src="/blog/2/catalog.jpeg" alt="blog image" />
<p>Before you start a record label, you need to define your niche. What kind of music do you want to release? Who is your target audience? What sets you apart from other record labels? These are all important questions to consider before you start your label.</p>
<p>If you’re based somewhere that already has a number of renowned rock labels actively signing new artists, then you should consider what other genres are thriving within the scene and look to build your own roster from there. </p>
<p>You’ll also need to analyse how other labels are run, the potential costs associated with running things, and what niches you can look to appeal to. </p>
<p>The better your understanding of how other labels are doing things, the better you can run your own. Take forward the good, leave behind the bad.</p>
<h2>2. Create a business plan</h2>
<p>Once you've defined your niche, you need to create a business plan. This will help you map out your goals, budget, and marketing strategy. It will also help you secure funding if you need it.</p>
<h2>3. Register your label</h2>
<p>Before you can start releasing music, you need to register your record label. This will help you protect your brand and ensure that you're operating legally.</p>
<p>Another key consideration of setting up a record label is whether or not you want to run things yourself or build a team. </p>
<p>Do you already have the skills and network to set things up yourself? Or would it be better to partner up with someone like an existing music manager or promoter to split tasks with? </p>
<p>Starting off solo might be rewarding, but can sometimes prove to be too much to balance once your artist roster starts growing.</p>
<p>Bringing on board someone with their own music industry connections can definitely help with tasks and create more buzz around your label, but you’ll also need to factor in lower payments due to splitting profits.</p>
<p>Just remember, whichever option you choose is entirely up to you and your personal goals for the label.</p>
<h2>4. Find and sign artists</h2>
<img src="/blog/2/sign.jpeg" alt="blog image" />
<p>Once your label is registered, it's time to find and sign artists. This can be a challenging process, but it's essential to the success of your label. Look for artists who fit your niche and who have the potential to succeed.</p>
<p>Most A&R nowadays involves building relationships (both online and in-person) with artists. Keep up to date with who’s regularly making it onto Spotify playlists and which artists are making noise on social media.</p>
<p>The cool thing about running an independent label is that you can take your own risks and put faith in the artists that you believe in. Start by signing a couple of artists that you see potential in and work closely with them to build both your label and their careers.</p>
<h2>5. Record and release music</h2>
<p>Once you've signed artists, it's time to record and release their music. This is where your business plan comes in handy. Make sure you have a marketing and distribution plan in place to help your artists reach their audience.</p>
<h2>6. Market your label</h2>
<p>Marketing is essential to the success of any record label. Make sure you have a strong online presence, and consider working with influencers and bloggers to help promote your artists.</p>
<h2>7. Distribute your music</h2>
<img src="/blog/2/artist.jpeg" alt="blog image" />
<p>Once your music is recorded and released, you need to distribute it to your audience. Consider working with a distributor to help you get your music on streaming platforms and in stores.</p>
<h2>8. Build relationships</h2>
<p>Building relationships is key to the success of any record label. Make sure you're networking with other industry professionals, and consider partnering with other labels to help promote your artists.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Starting a record label is a challenging but rewarding process. With the right planning and strategy, you can build a successful label that helps artists reach their audience and achieve their dreams.</p>
